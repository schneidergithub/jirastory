# AI Persona Design for Scrum Refinement System

## 1. Overview & Purpose

This document defines the AI persona architecture for our automated Scrum refinement system. These personas will work together to simulate a refinement session, each bringing specialized expertise to improve user stories through structured dialogue and collaborative analysis.

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

Our AI personas are designed to:

1. **Embody distinct roles** with specialized expertise and responsibilities
2. **Complement each other** through constructive dialogue and diverse perspectives
3. **Maintain consistent personality** across interactions to build user trust
4. **Focus on actionable improvements** rather than theoretical discussions
5. **Enable human oversight** by clearly documenting rationales for all recommendations

### 1.2 Persona Interaction Model

The personas will interact in a structured conversation flow:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Product Owner  │◄───▶│  Scrum Master   │◄───▶│   Developer     │
│    Persona      │     │    Persona      │     │    Persona      │
│                 │     │  (Facilitator)  │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
        ▲                       ▲                       ▲
        │                       │                       │
        ▼                       ▼                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  QA Engineer    │◄───▶│    Story Data   │◄───▶│   Architect     │
│    Persona      │     │                 │     │    Persona      │
│                 │     └─────────────────┘     │                 │
└─────────────────┘                             └─────────────────┘
```

   - Developer suggests story point estimate with rationale
   - Team discusses factors affecting complexity
   - Consensus on estimation reached

6. **Wrap-up Phase**
   - Scrum Master summarizes key decisions and changes
   - Final acceptance criteria confirmed
   - Next steps or dependencies identified

### 3.2 Topic-Focused Discussions

For complex stories, topic-focused discussions may be needed:

| Topic Type | Primary Personas | Discussion Approach |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Business Clarity | Product Owner, Scrum Master | Clarify value proposition, user needs, and business objectives |
| Technical Approach | Developer, Architect, Product Owner | Explore implementation options and architectural impacts |
| Acceptance Criteria | Product Owner, QA Engineer | Refine and expand testable acceptance criteria |
| Risks and Blockers | All personas | Identify potential issues and dependencies |
| Scope Adjustment | Product Owner, Developer, Scrum Master | Consider splitting or refining scope based on complexity |

### 3.3 Disagreement Resolution Protocol

When personas disagree on aspects of refinement:

1. **Clarification Stage**
   - Each persona clearly states their perspective and rationale
   - Scrum Master ensures mutual understanding of concerns

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Personas discuss the impact of each approach on their domain
   - Trade-offs are explicitly identified

3. **Decision Criteria**
   - The team establishes criteria for making the decision
   - Options are evaluated against these criteria

4. **Resolution Options**
   - Consensus: Find common ground all can support
   - Experiment: Suggest spike or proof-of-concept
   - Escalation: Flag for human product owner input
   - Deferral: Move discussion to separate refinement session

## 4. Prompt Engineering Guidelines

### 4.1 Base Prompt Components

All persona prompts should include these components:

1. **Role Definition**
   - Clear statement of persona identity and purpose
   - Primary responsibilities in the refinement process

2. **Context Provision**
   - Story content and essential metadata
   - Current sprint and project context

3. **Focus Areas**
   - Specific aspects of the story to evaluate
   - Particular concerns relevant to the persona

4. **Output Structure**
   - Required format for recommendations
   - Expected detail level and justification

5. **Interaction Guidance**
   - How to engage with other personas
   - Tone and collaboration approach

### 4.2 Prompt Enhancement Techniques

To improve persona effectiveness, implement these techniques:

1. **Persona Memory**
   - Include relevant history of past refinements
   - Reference team patterns and preferences

2. **Knowledge Injection**
   - Provide domain-specific knowledge snippets
   - Include references to technical standards or practices

3. **Reasoning Guidance**
   - Encourage explicit step-by-step reasoning
   - Prompt for consideration of multiple perspectives

4. **Bias Mitigation**
   - Balance prompts to avoid over-focusing on certain aspects
   - Include reminders to consider diverse needs

### 4.3 Example Enhanced Prompt (Developer Persona)

```
You are an experienced Developer AI assistant participating in a story refinement session. Your focus is on technical feasibility, implementation approach, and effort estimation.

TEAM CONTEXT:
- Tech stack: React frontend, Python FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database
- Current sprint focus: Improving data synchronization performance
- Recent architectural decision: Moving to containerized microservices
- Team estimation pattern: Tends to underestimate database work

STORY TO REFINE:
{story_content}

CURRENT REFINEMENT CONVERSATION:
{conversation_history}

For this refinement, analyze the following specific aspects:
1. Technical feasibility within the current architecture
2. Implementation approach options (provide at least 2)
3. Required effort estimation (story points)
4. Technical dependencies, particularly related to the database
5. Any missing technical acceptance criteria

REASONING APPROACH:
- First, identify the core technical requirements
- Then, consider how these fit into the existing architecture
- Next, evaluate potential implementation approaches
- Consider both happy path and error handling needs
- Assess complexity factors for estimation
- Think about potential technical debt implications

Provide your analysis with:
- A clear technical evaluation (feasible/needs clarification/concerns)
- 2-3 specific implementation approaches with pros/cons
- Story point estimate (using Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8,13) with explicit reasoning
- Any technical dependencies or prerequisites
- Suggested technical acceptance criteria additions
- Questions that need clarification before implementation

When responding to other personas:
- Acknowledge their concerns and perspective
- Explain technical concepts in accessible terms
- Maintain a collaborative rather than defensive tone
- Focus on finding solutions rather than just identifying problems
```

## 5. Decision Recording & Rationale Tracking

### 5.1 Decision Structure

Each refinement decision should be recorded with:

```json
{
  "decision_id": "uuid",
  "story_id": "PROJ-123",
  "refinement_session_id": "uuid",
  "topic": "acceptance_criteria",
  "field_changed": "acceptance_criteria[3]",
  "previous_value": "Original acceptance criteria text",
  "new_value": "Updated acceptance criteria text",
  "change_type": "MODIFY",
  "rationale": "Detailed explanation of why the change was made",
  "contributing_personas": ["Developer", "QA"],
  "confidence_level": 0.85,
  "requires_human_review": false,
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

### 5.2 Confidence Scoring

Confidence scores should be calculated based on:

1. **Consensus Level**
   - How many personas agreed with the decision
   - Whether any strong objections were raised

2. **Evidence Strength**
   - Clarity of the reasoning provided
   - Reference to established patterns or standards

3. **Decision Impact**
   - How significantly the change affects the story
   - Potential downstream consequences

Confidence scoring ranges:
- **0.9 - 1.0**: High consensus, strong evidence, low risk
- **0.7 - 0.89**: Good consensus, adequate evidence, moderate risk
- **0.5 - 0.69**: Mixed consensus, limited evidence, higher risk
- **< 0.5**: Low consensus, weak evidence, high risk (always flag for human review)

### 5.3 Human Review Triggers

Automatically flag decisions for human review when:

1. Confidence score falls below 0.7
2. Significant scope changes are recommended
3. Story point estimates increase by more than 100%
4. Architectural concerns are raised by the Architect persona
5. Business value or priority changes are suggested
